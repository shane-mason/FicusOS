# FicusOS
This repository houses FicusOS, an operating system for the Ficus computer, a custom hardware architecture made from standard micro-controller units (MCUs). This is an experiment in building a custom operating system on a simplified architecture of multiple independent processing nodes.

## Ficus Hardware Architecture
The overall design philosophy for the Ficus architecture is based around the metaphor of its name-sake tree - with its complex, interconnected roots and branches. The reference implementation for the Ficus architecture is shown below. Each MCU represents a 'node' in the Ficus tree and performs a specific function.
